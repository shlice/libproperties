  1.add a class TiXmlDoctype extend TiXmlComment date:2007/10/04
  2.add a class TiXmlDeclarationWithoutStandalone extend TiXmlDeclaration date:2007/10/04

	Because the class "Properties" in java need
	   <!DOCTYPE properties SYSTEM "http://java.sun.com/dtd/properties.dtd">
	   in xml file, its dtd is:

	   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
             <!-- DTD for properties -->
             <!ELEMENT properties ( comment?, entry* ) >
             <!ATTLIST properties version CDATA #FIXED "1.0">
             <!ELEMENT comment (#PCDATA) >
             <!ELEMENT entry (#PCDATA) >
             <!ATTLIST entry key CDATA #REQUIRED>

	so if i want java class Properties can use the xml file which is created by libproperties,
	i must modify tinyxml.

!!!!!!!NOTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	1.The two class is JUST written for libproperties! 
	  If you don't know what you will do, please don't use them!
	
	2.The two class is OUT of tinyxml.
	  So you can use tinyxml in your wise.

	thank tinyxml :-)
